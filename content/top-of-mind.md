This is sort of an outline to find whatever you want to read from me. I'm taking a ton of notes using [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/).

Once Roam Research adds a feature for directly sharing notes, I'll be able to pull them in directly. Until then, I'll be bringing my more developed notes here.

Let me know if you like anything, or want to learn more about something. My contact info is in the bottom 📬.
