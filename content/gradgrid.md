[GradGrid](https://www.gradgrid.org/) is a hometown centric networking platform that empowers hometowns by connecting natives with each other and local industries. 

I'm currently thinking on the [[GradGrid Job Board]]

I've always been passionate about developing the tech scene in my hometown Jasper, Indiana. In high school I actually worked on a nonprofit called [[LEAF]] that taught STEM through project based learning. So when [Luke Hochgesang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukehochgesang) and [Noah Bawel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahbawel) brought the idea to me in the summer of 2018 I was all for it.

We started with our hometown as a non-profit, and when mayors from nearby wanted something similar, we realized we had a potential business. So now we're working on expanding into 3 other towns.

Originally GradGrid was mainly an alumni database that let alumni search each other by fields like industry, grad year, and location. Now we're learning from our sponsors that a job board may be a more direct and effective way of helping our sponsors and alumni re-connect.

We also send [quarterly newsletters](https://www.gradgrid.org/newsletters) on what's going on in the town to users that get an amazing open rate. We've built on this by sending job opportunities over email.
