    - Wanted to do some painting, but didn't have paint. So I started making a robot painter instead ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ¨ðŸ–Œ.

I'm going to have it "paint" historical painting on my new tab screen on chrome throughout the day. Here's how day 1 went:
    - My game plan is to convert the paintings to a SVG file, which breaks them down into "lines". I can do more interesting things like paint or reveal these areas with these lines later on probably.

    - The colors and strokes are funky, but the picture is still pretty well there. So I started experimenting with having the robot paint those lines. Right now it's just using a pencil (flat line), so I'll have to swap in a paint brush later.

    - I found a way to use a paintbrush effect instead of the flat pencil so the robot can recreate the picture better, but I'll have to re-do a lot of things by hand to make it work.

    - That's all for now! I haven't done a purely fun project in a while so I've loved this. I'll keep everyone posted on the progress.
