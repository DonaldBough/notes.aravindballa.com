title: About these notes  
---  

Hey there! I'm Donald Bough. You've found my working notes. This style of note taking, or thinking, is a little different so let me explain.      
      
Inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/), I've learned that writing is a crucial way [to develop new and original ideas](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6cFzJWgj9vZpnrQsjrZ8yCNREzCTgyFeVZTb). I use these notes to think about things I've read or am working on, and discover how they connect to other books and projects. This prevents me from taking what authors say as facts, allowing my own creation of connections and opinions.    
    
I hope sharing these publicly will spark fun and interesting conversations in my existing friend group and anyone else out there. If something stands out, feel free to say hi. üëã
      
Here's my current top of mind:    
- Co-founding [[GradGrid]]        
- Software craftsmanship      
- Entrepreneurship
