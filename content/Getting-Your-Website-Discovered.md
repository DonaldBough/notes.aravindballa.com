title: Getting Your Website Discovered ðŸ”Ž  
---  
After working on SEO, Google Rankings, and discoverability for a couple of companies I finally wrote my prcoess down. It's simple, and covers everything.
- ## Beginning to End Simple Gameplan:
    - Hereâ€™s the high level summary of steps to follow. Look in SEO Checklist from Weebly for details.
        - Register a custom domain
        - Do a brain dump of all relevant words for your business
        - Make URLs more relevant
    - __e.g. Going from SockStore.com/products to SockStore.com/socks. Bad, overspecific example is SockStore.com/YellowAndBlueSocks__
        - Add relevant title tags and detailed meta descriptions for each page using [this preview tool](https://smartsearchmarketing.com/google-title-tag-serp-preview-tool). Tags and descripts are what Google search results displays.
    - **Example description:**__. French Bulldogs For Sale in Indiana__
    - **Example description:**__ As a top Indiana dog breeder with over 20 years of experience, we pride ourselves on having the cutest puppies around. View our adorable french bulldogs!__
        - Add the summarizing words as meta tags.
    - **Example meta keywords:**__ french bulldog, puppies, for sale, male, breeder, small, cuteÂ __
        - Re-evaluate content per page. Add H1,H2,etcâ€¦
        - Add call to action buttons, meta alt tag descriptions for each image. __Example image alt tag descriptions: Cream colored, perky dog smiling at the camera on a patch of grass__
        - Check that each page clearly links to rest of website.
