title: Developers Thrive When Building üèó  
---

In [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/), Eric Ries brought up something along the lines that craftsmen (developers in his example) needed to constantly be building projects to thrive. In a different universe, [a pianist interviewed for the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/igor-levit-is-like-no-other-pianist) was being celebrated for streaming concerts during the quarantine. When he began to receive widespread recognition for this, he desperately expressed that all he wanted to do was SOMETHING in a time where he couldn‚Äôt go out and perform.

How often do developers feel the need to build something, JUST to build it? Plenty. I know in college so much of my hands on learning came from problems that I pulled out, honestly to just have a problem to work on.

It feels like how a shark needs to move through water to survive

Could this put myself at a disadvantage? Would my constant desire to work on something (anything) constantly distract me from envisioning and focusing in on a true problem that other‚Äôs experience? Or is this kind of fuel what it takes to go the full length it takes to solve it?

There is probably a balance somewhere in between. A shark can have direction when constantly needing to move. Maybe that‚Äôs why mindfulness is so powerful for entrepreneurs. It gives us time to re-ground and refocus. Yes we‚Äôre allowed to stray from the vision of our current business or project to work on a fun javascript confetti popper, that‚Äôs part of the fun. The real danger can be swimming in too deep into a project that won‚Äôt let us financially sustain ourselves.

We can always keep swimming, but we have to find enough fish along the way. Maybe once we find more than we could ever need, is when we‚Äôll the most fun paths are actually the most calorie-filled ones.
