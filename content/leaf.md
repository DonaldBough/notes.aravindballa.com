title: L.E.A.F. (Learning Experiences in Applied Fields)  
---  
LEAF's mission was to show how fun learning can be when doing it through hands on projects. Myself and a group of others worked on this for around two years in high school. We ran a mentor mentee system around STEM fields since that's what we had experience in.  
  
Budding LEAF was a camp for elementary and middle schoolers that had some fun projects around architecture, engineering, and programming. We even [built a rocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTqkbklX_v8) ðŸš€. Here's our [opening day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUoTSeFze10), [the first newsletter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B59ultqfrmxwSW5yVUZvN3FaN28/view?usp=sharing) to parents of the mentees, and the way back finder [backup of our website](http://web.archive.org/web/20160313013847/http://leafteam.org:80/).  
  
Towards the end we began to expand to a town nearby as well.  
  
Unfortunately it fizzled out once the once we (the original founders) graduated high school and lost momentum. LEAF was my first taste of entrepreneurship and what it would take to lead something.
